# Overview

In this repository, an interactive map of Earthquakes was created used GeoJSON data and stylized using the MapBox API and the Leaflet JavaScript library. Using the Leaflet library, markers and popups were created for coordinates retrieved from GeoJSON data for earthquakes from the past 7 days with varying magnitudes. The interactive map allows for 3 different map styles, Streets, Satellite, and Navigation (Night) from the MapBox API that can be alternated between. In addition to that, 3 layers are able to be overlaid onto the map to show all Earthquakes, tectonic plates, and Earthquakes recorded with magnitudes over 4.5. 

# Results

The interactive map features 3 different styles to choose from, along with 3 different layers that can be used simultaneously.

Additional styles and layers can be added to show other related information. In this interactive map we can see earthquakes occurring at the tectonic plates and identify where the more powerful earthquakes occurred. Using the GeoJSON data, other properties like the time can be included in the markers if desired.
